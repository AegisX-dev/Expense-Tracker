## üîÑ Migration Guide

### Upgrading from v1.x to v2.0

**Data Migration:**
The application automatically migrates data from v1.x format:
```javascript
// Old format (v1.x)
{
  "transactions": [
    { "amount": 100, "category": "food", "date": "2023-12-01" }
  ]
}

// New format (v2.0)
{
  "transactions": [
    { 
      "id": "tx_001", 
      "amount": 100, 
      "category": "food", 
      "date": "2023-12-01",
      "currency": "USD",
      "type": "expense"
    }
  ],
  "settings": { "currency": "USD", "theme": "light" },
  "budgets": []
}
```

**Breaking Changes:**
